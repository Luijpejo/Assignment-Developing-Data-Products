# Assignment-Developing-Data-Products
This repository contains the files required for the final assignment of the course Developing Data Products

For this assignment I have created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. Next to that I have created a reproducible pitch presentation about my application, using R Markdown within RStudio.
The original request was to use either Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare this presentation, but my version of RStudio (RStudio 2023.03.0+386) does not support that anymore. Instead it supports the more advanced R Markdown.

I have stored all the files that I have created for this assignment in this repository
- the ui.R file
- the server.R file
- the original R Markdown file for the presentation
- the generated presentation - in html
- the datafile that I have used within my presentation:
    the Dutch Central Statistic Agency ("Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek"- CBS) publishes its data on their own public website. Citizens can download these files.
    One of these files is about the percentage of overweighted people in the Netherlands within certain years. 
    "https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/81565NED/table"
    I have used this file in my presentation to create a plot, since the topic of my application is the Body Mass Index (BMI). I have modified the file to enable the creation of the plot.
    
    
The Shiny application is also published on Shiny.io: "https://jolu1965.shinyapps.io/Assignment_week4_Developing_Data_Products/"
The Presentation is also published on RPubs: "".
